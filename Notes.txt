Notes for seedpicker 3.0
############################################################

This version of seedpicker will contains a new data handing system 
known as "smart sampling". Where the matrix creation is being built 
by parts.

This version will still retain the generator function "iterloads", however 
it will have an added option known as "by_row" and the default known as 
"by_two" 




-------------
| Todo list |
-------------
[ ] = "by_two": Remove the "unique" combination and just do all possible combinations 
                The unique combinations prevents the creation of the full matrix 

[ ] = "by_group": {New feature!} loads the trajectories per row! that is dependent by group 


[ ] = Test performance 

[ ] = Ensure effcient data storage 

[ ] = make the labled trajs dependent on iterloads 





----------
| Notes   | 
-----------
- make sure the merge the trajectories when doing the long row. so it should be (rowTraj, [meregedColtrajs])
- iterload should only return the row index and column index not merged ([trajob1, trajob 3], {coltra1, coltraj2 coltraj3 .. coltraj4})




- The new generator "by_row" should be [traj1 obj], [merged_trajs]
